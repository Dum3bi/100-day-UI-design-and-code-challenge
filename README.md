# Documenting my 100 days Daily UI Design challenge



In 2019, I kicked off my product design adventure with the Daily UI challenge, but life got busy and I wasn't able to finish it.
This time around, I'm picking up where I left off with a twist: I'll be tackling the daily prompts by not only designing the UI, but also building it in code!

Same prompts
100 days,
UI design + Code
