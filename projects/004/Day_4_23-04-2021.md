## Notes

Made progress today!

- Avoided repeating yesterday’s mistakes and improved my workflow from 6 to 4hrs by chunking tasks (Design -> HTML -> CSS -> Inspect & fix QA issues).

- Switched the form input font from ‘SF Mono’ (webfont challenges) to ‘Roboto Mono’ for faster progress.

- Found a clever workaround on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20740523/place-an-image-inside-a-text-field) to implement the VISA logo in the card number field. 

I really enjoyed today's task and will have to plan my week to enable handle the design and code of the other 6 challenges I need to complete this week.

2 down, 98 to go!
