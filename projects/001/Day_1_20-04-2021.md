## References

I got inspiration from [WorkOS](https://dashboard.workos.com/signin) sign in page, as well as a page template from [Rayna UI Design System](https://www.raynaui.com/)


## Notes

The process was more challenging than expected given I had some prior knowledge of HTML CSS and JS but I was stuck a couple of times while trying to make sure build was consistent with the design.

I had to refer to a couple of sites like [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and of course, [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

I also refreshed my markdown knowledge with [The Ultimate Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/lifeparticle/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [Mahbub Zaman](https://github.com/lifeparticle)
