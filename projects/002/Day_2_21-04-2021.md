 I was inspired by the  [Bombardier Business Aircraft website ](https://businessaircraft.bombardier.com/en/aircraft/global-8000#bba-pdp-section-1), I also referenced  [Paystacks checkout](https://paystack.com/demo/checkout) in their demo page as well as the form input designs by

## Notes

Today's task was easier to work on as I avoided mistakes I made yesterday. I also tried to chunk the tasks by working on the design first, HTML second, CSS third, and then inspcting the build to fix errors.

I had to change the initial mono typeface i wanted to use for the form input text from 'SF Mono' to 'Roboto Mono' as I could not find a way to use SF mono as a webfont and I needed to move quickly. 

I was also stuck when trying to implement the VISA logo in the 'card number' field. I used a workaround i found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20740523/place-an-image-inside-a-text-field)

I really enjoyed today's task and will have to plan my week to enable handle the design and code of the other 6 challenges I need to complete this week.
